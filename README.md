# MiniBench-WIP
Somewhere to try out some ideas for MiniBench

- [x] Code tidy-up
- [ ] Implement full App-Domain functionality (as per Jon's demo code)
- [x] Command line argument processing (find a decent 3rd party library)
- [ ] Better results statistics (e.g. min, max +/- error, std-dev, etc)
- [x] NuGet package (set "post-build" step and add a sample Benchmark)
- [ ] Use a different (better?) templating mechanism
- [x] Profiler support, e.g. to get assembly code generated by the JITter (only GC Info so far)
